# Geolocation of Addresses with Google Maps

#Description: 

This project reads addresses from a document, finds possible homonymous addresses most similar to those in the original file, and queries the Google API to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates. This allows you to use a geolocator that displays the coordinates on the map.

 4. Install Dependencies from "requirements.txt": 
   Use the command pip install -r requirements.txt to install the project dependencies.
